# Conclusion {-}

If we don't want Conclusion to have a chapter number next to it, we can add the `{-}` attribute.

**More info**

And here's some other random info: the first paragraph after a chapter title or section head _shouldn't be_ indented, because indents are to tell the reader that you're starting a new paragraph. Since that's obvious after a chapter or section title, proper typesetting doesn't add an indent there.

## Future Work

There are so many exciting unexplored methods and tweaks that would be worth investigating.

Many I don't know how to implement, couldn't find a good use, don't understand enough, or was computationally restricted, especially during monte carlo simulation!

Can do a paragraph on the most important things here:

- something better than linear regression: local polynomial, etc
- training neural networks correctly: finding the validation minima then re-training every time. I was prevented by computational intensity
- tweaks on neural networks: **reinforcement learning**, dropout layers, noise layers, pre-trained networks
- re-visiting weighted resampling by trying bootstrapping methods, bigger resample. bootstrapping many datasets, training on each, and taking mean of estimates. somethign like this to stabilize predictions and sampling variability.

Multiple imputation: since hopefully NN preserve intervarabhle relationships better than linear or median etc
