Missing data is problematic and pervasive in real surveys. Complex survey imputation aims to replace missing data with approximations. Modified neural networks (weighted loss, weighted resample, $\pi$-feature, derived parameter) are compared to weighted linear regression for mean estimation in artificial and real data using Monte Carlo simulation on imputation of manually-induced missing data. The methods' population mean estimates are compared to the known true mean in both experiments. The results show the effectiveness of the neural network family in low-noise nonlinear generative functions, and XXXXX in Bureau of Labour Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey data. Keras and tensorFlow are utilized for neural network models.
