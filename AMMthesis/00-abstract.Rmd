Missing data is problematic and pervasive in real surveys. Complex survey imputation aims to replace missing data with approximations. Modified neural networks (weighted loss, weighted resample, $\pi$-feature, derived parameter) are compared to weighted linear regression for mean estimation in artificial and real data using Monte Carlo simulation on imputation of manually-induced missing data. The methods' population mean estimates are compared to the known true mean in both experiments. The results show the effectiveness of the neural network family in low-noise nonlinear generative functions, and XXXXX in Bureau of Labour Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey data. Keras and tensorFlow are utilized for neural network models.

Neural Network Imputation
In Complex Survey Design 

Abstract—Missing data yields many analysis challenges. In case
of complex survey design, in addition to dealing with missing data,
researchers need to account for the sampling design to achieve useful
inferences. Methods for incorporating sampling weights in neural
network imputation were investigated to account for complex survey
designs. An estimate of variance to account for the imputation
uncertainty as well as the sampling design using neural networks will
be provided. A simulation study was conducted to compare
estimation results based on complete case analysis, multiple
imputation using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and neural network
imputation. Furthermore, a public-use dataset was used as an
example to illustrate neural networks imputation under a complex
survey design.

Keywords—Complex survey, estimate, imputation, neural
networks, variance.
