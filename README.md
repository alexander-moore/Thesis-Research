# Thesis-Research
### Fall 2018

This repository is my ongoing undergraduate research project for Reed College, advised by [Dr. Kelly McConville](https://github.com/mcconvil)

This project examines multiple methods to account for complex survey design in the training of neural networks. These methods are to resample the data according to the inclusion probability of the observations, to weight the loss function in the training of the network, and to make available the inclusion probability of the observation as a feature.
