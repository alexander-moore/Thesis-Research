This repository is my ongoing undergraduate research project for Reed College, advised by [Dr. Kelly McConville](https://github.com/mcconvil)

The impacts of complex survey design in the training of machine learning algorithms is an unignorable effect. This project examines multiple methods to account for complex survey design in the training of neural networks. The following methods are considered:
- **Weighted Resampling**: Resample the data according to the inclusion probability of the observations.
- **Weighted Loss Function**: Weight the loss function in the training of the network by the inclusion probability of the observation.
- **Pi Feature**: Make available the inclusion probability of the observation as a feature in the training and testing of the network.
